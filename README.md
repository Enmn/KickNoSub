## About This Project

**KickNoSub** is a dual-component project consisting of:

1. **KickNoSub Tool (Python CLI)** — a command-line utility that demonstrates how stream metadata can be accessed programmatically.
2. **KickNoSub Chrome Extension** — a browser extension that provides a user-friendly interface for retrieving stream information directly from Kick pages.

This project is intended **for educational, research, and learning purposes only.**
